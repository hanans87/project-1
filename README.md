# Tic Tac Toe

This is my first project with no experience.

How to create a Tic Tic To
-Create an html page .
-Link The html page with CSS, which is use to design the webpage.
- Any action created by JavaScript.

How it works

- Player select the mark either "X" or "O".
- Player will play with the computer.
- Player win with mark   "X" ,"X","X" OR "O".
-  Reset  the game if one of the  players win.

Thoughts;
- To be able to create any game you have to be creative. 
- Building games depends on logic will save more time to discover more.

Advice;
- Make sure that you create a vision and wireframe before writing codes (Brain Storm).
- Focus on logic in JS instead of design the page. In other words, focus on the content not the cover.
